# Mailers
Set of Mailer for daily uses

I'll be creating some exciting and responsive newsletters templates for daily use. I started with NPS feedback mailer in mind. NPS scale is 100% responsive, fit-to-device.

I tested it in Gmail and noticed alert suggesting risks behind forms in mailer. So, I have used anchor tags to get response instead of using radio buttons.
